# Production Deployment Checklist for ZK Wage Proof Circuit

## 🎯 Critical Requirements for Production Launch

### 1. Trusted Setup Ceremony  **CRITICAL**

  - Check for under-constrained variables
  - Validate ECDSA signature verification logic
  - Ensure no information leakage through constraints

- [ ] **Code review of SnarkJS integration**
  - Validate input sanitization
  - Check proof verification logic
  - Review nullifier storage/checking

### 3. Performance Validation  **HIGH PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Benchmark on production hardware**
  - Test on target server specifications

  - Test memory usage patterns

- [ ] **Load testing**
  - Simulate concurrent proof generation
  - Test system behavior under high load
  - Validate queue management for proof requests

### 4. ECDSA Implementation 🔐 **CRITICAL**

  - Current implementation in circuit is demo-only
  - Integrate proper secp256k1 ECDSA verification
  - Test with real Ethereum signatures
  - Validate signature format compatibility

### 5. Key Management 🗝️ **CRITICAL**

- [ ] **Secure employer key storage**
  - Implement HSM or secure enclave for employer private keys

  - Implement access controls and logging

- [ ] **Employee secret management**
  - Guide users on secure secret generation
  - Implement secure client-side key derivation
  - Provide backup/recovery mechanisms
  - Ensure secrets cannot be extracted from client

### 6. Nullifier System 📊 **HIGH PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Production nullifier database**
  - Design scalable nullifier storage (Redis/PostgreSQL)
  - Implement efficient nullifier checking
  - Set up monitoring for double-spend attempts
  - Plan for nullifier database backup/recovery

- [ ] **Nullifier cleanup policies**
  - Define retention periods for old nullifiers
  - Implement automated cleanup procedures
  - Plan for database growth management

### 7. Input Validation 🛡️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Comprehensive input sanitization**
  - Validate all numeric inputs are in expected ranges
  - Check string inputs for proper formatting
  - Implement rate limiting on proof generation
  - Add input fuzzing tests

- [ ] **Business logic validation**
  - Verify employer ID against approved employer list
  - Validate wage ranges make business sense
  - Check period ID format and reasonable dates
  - Implement employer reputation checking

### 8. Error Handling & Monitoring 📊 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Production logging**
  - Log all proof generation attempts
  - Monitor circuit compilation errors
  - Track performance metrics
  - Implement alerting for failures

- [ ] **Error recovery**
  - Handle circuit failures gracefully
  - Implement retry logic for transient failures
  - Provide clear error messages to users
  - Set up automated incident response

### 9. Infrastructure & Deployment 🏗️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Container deployment**
  - Create production Docker images
  - Set up Kubernetes deployment manifests
  - Configure auto-scaling policies
  - Implement health checks

- [ ] **Resource management**
  - Size containers for proof generation workload
  - Configure memory limits and CPU allocation
  - Plan for proof generation queue management
  - Set up horizontal scaling

### 10. Documentation & Operations 📚 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Operational documentation**
  - Document deployment procedures
  - Create incident response playbooks
  - Write troubleshooting guides
  - Document monitoring and alerting

- [ ] **User documentation**
  - API documentation for integration
  - Client SDK documentation
  - Error code reference
  - Integration examples

## 🚀 Pre-Launch Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Circuit Testing
1. Run full test suite: `npm test`
2. Performance benchmark: `npm run benchmark`
3. Constraint analysis: Verify circuit has <50k constraints
4. Security audit of circuit code

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. Test with real Ethereum signatures
2. Validate against production employer data
3. Load test with simulated traffic
4. End-to-end testing with frontend/backend

### Phase 3: Security Testing
1. Penetration testing of API endpoints
2. Circuit constraint analysis
3. Trusted setup verification
4. Key management security review

### Phase 4: Production Validation
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run production-scale tests
3. Validate monitoring and alerting
4. Execute disaster recovery procedures

##  Security Warnings

### DO NOT use in production until:
1.  Trusted setup ceremony completed
2.  Security audit passed
3.  ECDSA implementation upgraded
4.  Key management implemented
5.  Nullifier system deployed

### Known vulnerabilities in current implementation:
- Development zkey is compromised (anyone can generate fake proofs)
- Simplified ECDSA allows signature forgery
- No rate limiting on proof generation
- No input validation on employer IDs
- Employee secrets stored in plaintext examples

## 📋 Launch Readiness Checklist
