# Stream iOS App - Setup Instructions

## 🚨 Current Issue

The Xcode developer directory is set to command line tools instead of the full Xcode installation. This prevents building iOS apps.

## 🔧 Quick Fix

Run this command to set the correct Xcode path:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

**Note**: You'll need to enter your admin password.

## ✅ Alternative: Open in Xcode (Recommended)

Since the code is already functional, the easiest way to build and run:

1. **Open Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open /Applications/Xcode.app
   ```

2. **Open Project**:
   - File → Open → Navigate to `/Users/ashwathreddymuppa/Stream/ios/StreamApp.xcodeproj`

3. **Select Simulator**:
   - Choose "iPhone 15" or any iPhone simulator from the dropdown

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Press `Cmd+R` or click the Play button

## 📱 What You'll See

The app will launch with this flow:
1. **Loading Screen** (1 second)
2. **Onboarding** (swipe through 4 pages)
3. **Authentication** (Face ID/Touch ID simulation)
4. **Main App** with tabs:
   - **Dashboard**: Shows earnings, work scenarios
   - **Work**: Track work sessions
   - **Proofs**: ZK proof generation
   - **Profile**: User settings

## 🧪 Running Tests

In Xcode:
1. Press `Cmd+U` to run all tests
2. Or go to Product → Test

### If Simulator Issues:
1. **Reset iOS Simulator**: 
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl erase all
   ```
2. **Choose Different Simulator**: Try iPhone 14 or iPhone 15 Pro
