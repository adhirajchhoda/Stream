## CONCLUSION

The risk assessment strongly supports a **stablecoin-first strategy** for Stream Protocol's initial deployment. This approach:

1. **Minimizes Technical Risk**: Simple, proven technology stack
2. **Reduces Regulatory Burden**: Clear legal framework, no banking licenses required
3. **Enables Rapid Development**: No external partnerships or approvals needed
4. **Maintains Future Flexibility**: Modular architecture supports future rail additions
5. **Aligns with Core Value**: Instant settlement supports "instant access" proposition

Traditional payment rails (ACH, cards, digital wallets) introduce significant regulatory, operational, and financial risks that are incompatible with a 48-hour development timeline. These should be addressed in subsequent phases with proper legal, compliance, and operational infrastructure.

The multi-rail architecture provides a compelling long-term vision while the stablecoin foundation delivers immediate, demonstrable value with manageable risk.
