npm run demo

# Or run in auto mode (faster for presentations)
npm run demo:auto
```

### Demo Options

```bash
# Interactive demo (default)
npm run demo

# Fast auto mode for time-constrained presentations
npm run demo:auto

# Specific employer scenarios
npm run demo:starbucks    # Barista at Starbucks
npm run demo:amazon       # Warehouse worker at Amazon
npm run demo:uber         # Uber driver on Friday night
```

## 🎯 What Judges Will See

- ⚡ **Performance metrics** displayed live
- 🔒 **Privacy guarantees** clearly demonstrated
- 🛡️ **Security features** tested in real-time
- 💰 **Financial breakdown** with exact amounts

## 🎪 Demo Features

### Privacy Magic
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** hide all sensitive data
- Employee identity completely private
- Employer identity completely private
- Wage amounts verified but encrypted

### Performance Showcase
- Sub-5 second proof generation target
- Real-time performance metrics
- Visual feedback for all operations

### Security Demonstrations
- Double-spend prevention test
- Nullifier system validation
- Smart contract verification

### Realistic Scenarios
- **Starbucks**: Barista earning $144 for 8-hour shift
- **Amazon**: Warehouse worker earning $220 for 10-hour shift
- **Uber**: Driver earning $171 for 6-hour Friday night surge

## 🚀 Technical Innovation Points

### For Technical Judges
1. **Zero-Knowledge Circuits** - Custom zk-SNARKs for wage verification
2. **Smart Contract Integration** - Automated verification and disbursement
3. **Nullifier System** - Cryptographic double-spend prevention
