## üé™ Presentation Tips

### Demo Script (5-7 minutes)
1. **Introduction** (30s): "Stream Protocol enables private, instant wage advances"
2. **Scenario Setup** (60s): Choose employee and show work completion
3. **Proof Generation** (60s): Generate ZK proof with live timer
4. **Contract Interaction** (60s): Submit proof and show verification
5. **Results** (60s): Show fund disbursement and security features
6. **Q&A** (2-3 minutes): Answer technical questions

### Key Messages
- **Privacy**: "Complete identity protection using zero-knowledge proofs"
- **Performance**: "Sub-5 second proof generation on standard hardware"
- **Security**: "Cryptographic guarantees prevent all forms of fraud"
- **Scale**: "90 billion dollar market with universal employer support"

### If Using Fallbacks
- **Say**: "Using optimized demo mode for speed and reliability"
