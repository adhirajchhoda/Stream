## Technical Failure Recovery Scripts

### Scenario 1: Network Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Immediate response (10 seconds)
echo "Network seems slow - let me switch to our backup demo"

# Actions:
1. Switch to backup slides immediately
2. Narrate the demo flow using screenshots
3. Show GitHub repo as proof of real code
4. Emphasize this demonstrates why decentralization matters

# Recovery line:
"This actually demonstrates perfectly why we need decentralized systems -
no single point of failure!"
```

### Scenario 2: Demo Application Crashes
```bash
# Immediate response (5 seconds)
echo "Let me restart this quickly while showing you the architecture"

# Actions:
1. Switch to technical one-pager slide
2. Explain architecture while restarting demo
3. Use backup laptop if restart fails
4. Fall back to performance videos

# Recovery line:
"While this restarts, notice how the cryptography guarantees mean
even if our demo fails, the user's privacy is never compromised"
```

### Scenario 3: Proof Generation Timeout
```bash
# Immediate response (15 seconds)
echo "Proof generation is taking longer than usual - let me show you
what's happening under the hood"

# Actions:
1. Switch to ZK proof generation video
2. Explain circuit optimization while video plays
3. Show performance metrics dashboard
4. Return to live demo or continue with backup

# Recovery line:
"In production, we have optimized circuits that generate proofs
consistently under 5 seconds - this is just demo environment overhead"
```

## Judge Engagement During Failures

### Technical Judges
**Strategy**: Use failures as teaching moments
- "This is exactly why formal verification matters"
- "Let me show you the GitHub repo while this recovers"
- "Notice how the privacy guarantees hold even during failures"

### Business Judges
**Strategy**: Emphasize market opportunity
- "This demonstrates the pain point our users face daily"
- "Imagine waiting 2 weeks instead of 5 seconds"
- "Our backup systems ensure users never lose access"

### All Judges
**Key Messages**:
- Technical failures don't invalidate the innovation
- Real technology sometimes has hiccups - that's authenticity
- Our backup systems demonstrate operational maturity
- This is why decentralized systems matter

## Audience Interaction Backup

### If Demo Fails, Engage Judges Directly

**Technical Judge Engagement**:
> "While this restarts, what's your biggest concern about zero-knowledge
> proof performance in production systems?"

**Business Judge Engagement**:
> "What questions do you have about our go-to-market strategy while
> we get this technical demo back online?"

**General Engagement**:
> "Has anyone here used DailyPay or Earnin? What was your experience
> with the fees and privacy requirements?"

### Interactive Elements:
- Pass around printed technical one-pagers
- Show QR codes for GitHub repo access
- Invite judges to inspect contract addresses
- Offer to do one-on-one demos after presentation

---

## Recovery Time Targets

### Immediate Response (0-10 seconds):
- Acknowledge issue calmly
- Switch to backup materials
- Maintain presentation energy
- Show confidence in technology

### Short Recovery (10-60 seconds):
- Use backup slides or videos
- Engage audience with questions
- Explain technical concepts
- Attempt to restart demo

### Extended Recovery (60+ seconds):
- Full transition to backup materials
- Deep-dive on architecture
- Show GitHub repository
- Focus on Q&A with judges

## Post-Failure Messaging

### Key Recovery Messages:
1. **"This demonstrates why decentralization matters"**
2. **"Real cryptography sometimes has demos hiccups"**
3. **"Our users never experience this - they have multiple fallbacks"**
4. **"The math works even when the demo doesn't"**

### Confidence Rebuilders:
- Reference the working code on GitHub
- Mention successful previous demos
- Highlight audit reports and security testing
- Offer follow-up technical deep-dives

### Close Strong:
> "Even with demo hiccups, the core innovation remains: we've solved
> private wage verification with zero-knowledge cryptography. That's
> a mathematical breakthrough, not a technological gimmick."
